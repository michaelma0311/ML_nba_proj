# NBA Game Prediction Model

This project is a machine learning model designed to predict the outcome of NBA games based on historical data. The model uses Ridge Classifier and features various statistics like team performance, player performance, and game statistics. It utilizes time-series cross-validation to evaluate performance and uses rolling averages for smoothing the data.

## Features
- Predict the winner of NBA games based on past performance data.
- Utilizes Ridge Classifier for the machine learning model.
- Time-series cross-validation to simulate real-world prediction scenarios.
- Rolling average features to smooth game data over time.
- Implements feature selection using Sequential Feature Selector (SFS).

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `sklearn`
- `matplotlib` (for potential visualizations)

## Frontend still in progress...
